# Arcade collection
 Simple game collection, that contains two games: 
  1. Pong
  2. Arkanoid
  
  I may add more games in the future, but I will have to redesign the architecture of the whole framework for ECS for that, since I am not satisfied with the solution in this project.
  This project was written in C++, using raylib.
 In this project, I learned:
 - How to work with raylib.
 - Learned how to serialize data using external library and my custom solution
 - Implemented message system between objects, but it's messy tho
 - Implemented object table for scenes
 - Learned a little bit of STL
 - How to create a level editor for Arkanoid, but it's a closed source because it was intended for one-time use only
 - Crosscompile from Linux to Windows using MingW compiler
 - Learned how to use CMake build system 

Still, there are plenty of bugs(especially in Arkanoid, as you can see in footage below)
